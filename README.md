Infill Incentive Package Calculator  
<h1> Infill Web Application </h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
This calculator is tailored for infill incentive applicants, helping property developers and investors evaluate potential financial benefits associated with their projects. It provides estimates for property tax rebates, construction material tax rebates, and construction permit fee rebates over either a 5-year or 10-year period based on the property type (e.g., brownfield or greyfield).

In addition to precise rebate calculations, the tool generates a 20% range above and below each value, allowing users to consider both conservative and optimistic financial projections. This flexible estimation range aids applicants in making well-informed decisions about potential incentives.
